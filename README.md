- `_config.yml` is the YAML file used to generate `conf.py` when creating the JupyterBook
- `data` folder contains the data we used for analysis in csv format
- `environment.yml` contains the information needed to replicate our environment
- `figures` folder contains the figures generated by the notebook `main.ipynb`
- `Makefile` is a Makefile that allows you to build the system needed to run our analysis
- `requirements.txt` contains the requirements to build the JupyterBook
- `shetertools` folder contains utility functions and tests for them
- `_toc.yml` contains the table of contents for our JupyterBook
